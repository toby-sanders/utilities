% 2D: With the methods in this folder, you can
%       - construct different 2D shearlet systems
%       - compute 2D shearlet transforms
%       - compute 2D shearlet reconstructions
%
% 3D: With the methods in this folder, you can
%       - construct different 3D shearlet systems
%       - compute 3D shearlet transforms
%       - compute 3D shearlet reconstructions

% Data: This folder contains the images and videos used in the sample
% scripts.
%
% Examples: This folder contains several sample scripts that should give
% you a good understanding of how to use ShearLab 3D.
%
% Quick: This folder contains a simple method for doing the shearlet
% transform, hard thresholding and the reconstruction in just one step for
% 2D and 3D data.
%
% Util: This folder contains all methods used in ShearLab3D that are of
% little use on their own.
%
% CUDA: This folder contains one CUDA-Kernel needed for the construction of
% 3D shearlets.
